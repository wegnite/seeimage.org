## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Fundamental Principles

**Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.** Gemini's strength lies in its deep language understanding. A narrative, descriptive paragraph will almost always produce better, more coherent images than disconnected words.

### Photography Template Structure

```
A photorealistic [shot type] of [subject], [action or expression], 
set in [environment]. The scene is illuminated by [lighting description], 
creating a [mood] atmosphere. Shot with [camera details].
```

### Example Implementation
```
A photorealistic portrait of a young woman, laughing genuinely with 
head tilted back, set in a sunlit park. The scene is illuminated by 
golden hour sunlight creating warm lens flare, creating a joyful 
atmosphere. Shot with 85mm lens with beautiful bokeh background.
```
